# Welcome to TCDBtools.

The programs in this repository have been developed in collaboration between 
members of the SaierLab and the group of Dr. Gabriel Moreno-Hagelsieb from 
Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada.

The list below contains the main programs. Dependencies developed by us are 
not shown in this list, but they are included as part of the repository. 
Each program has its one help file:


**1.** famXpander.pl ([manual](manuals/famXpander.md))  
**2.** extractFamily.pl ([manual](manuals/extractFamily.md))  
**3.** areFamiliesHomologous.pl  
**4.** list_top_gsat_hits.pl  
**5.** findDistantFamilyHomologs.pl  
**6.** mkBlastClusters.pl

* **Note:**  
Make sure you download the perl modules and point your _$PERL5LIB_ 
enviroment variable to the destination directory.
